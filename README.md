DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

This project is a simple and interactive Weather Application that provides real-time weather updates using a third-party Weather API. The application allows users to search for a city and instantly get details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. It fetches live data from the API and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to check the weather anytime. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the weather data is retrieved dynamically through API calls. This project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs into web applications and is a great example of combining client-side development with real-time data fetching. It can be further enhanced with features like geolocation-based weather, multi-day forecasts, and responsive design for mobile devices.
